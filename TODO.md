- make odd grid sizes possible
- add controls to adjust grid size
- add controls to adjust cell size
- create a default "reset" state
- remove hue limit magic numbers
- rules should not be magic numbers i.e. if neighbour count for a birth was a variable it could be tweaked
- check/fix/add: propTypes and default props

## FUTURE

- make responsize (mobile)
- it would be cool if you could "paint" different examples
