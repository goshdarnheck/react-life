## FUTURE

- make App a functional component and refactor some functions out of the file
- move examples out of lib folder
- make it look a lot nicer :)
- "settings" should be taken out of the controls component and moved to their own
- add undo feature
- if the neighbour count for life/death/births were variables they could be changed to show rule variants of GoL
- sharable cell states
- ability to save cell states in localstorage?
- it would be cool if you could "paint" different examples
- give run speeds names
