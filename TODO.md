## FUTURE

- move examples out of lib folder, each example should be a separate file for maintainability
- click and drag to toggle cells
- it would be cool if you could "paint" different examples
- change settings to reachui sliders
- option to make the grid a "torus"
- button to run next generation (when paused?)
- "about" modal w/ reachui dialog
- add back examples library
