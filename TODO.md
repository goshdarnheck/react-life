- refactor getAliveNeighbourCount to a function that just calculates whether a cell should be alive or dead.
- add test for the new function described above
- grid data shouldn't include dead cells, and if we try to render a cell, if there is no data, it should just be assumed dead
- track births and deaths?
- add more examples
- make examples always drawn in the middle
- make the middle of the data always 0x0?
- when all cells are dead, it should auto-pause
- add info on the rules of CGoL
- add link to hamburgersandwich.com
- make responsize (mobile)
- it would be cool if you could "paint" different examples
- add controls to adjust speed
- add controls to adjust grid size?
