      <p>I made React Life it's great. It's Conway's Game of Life made in React, which is a bad idea.</p>
      <p>You shouldn't make Game of Life in React, but you can and it can handle it sort of.</p>
      <p>What is Game of Life???</p>
      <h3>Torus Mode</h3>
      <p>Torus mode treats edges of the grid as if they are touching the opposite side. Like a donut!</p>
      <h3>Mutation Mode</h3>
      <p>Mutation mode gives a "dead" cell with one neighbour a 1/1000th chance of becoming alive, and an "alive" cell with 3 neighbours a 1 in 1000 chance of dying.</p>
